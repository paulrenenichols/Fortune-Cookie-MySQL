This document describes how to restore the php-examples databse to your local MAMP instance.

1. Go to the MAMP start page.  You can get at the MAMP start page from the MAMP application window.  

 *Make sure MAMP is running before you do this.*

2. Go to the phpMyAdmin tab on the start page.  Click on the "Import" tab.

3. Choose the database backup file you want to restore.  In this case it's php-examples-(date_and_time).sql.

4. Once you've selected the file, make sure the "Character set of the file:" dropdown is set to utf-8.

5. Make sure that the "Format" is set to SQL, since our backup file is a sql file.

6. Now click on the "Go" button to start the restore.
