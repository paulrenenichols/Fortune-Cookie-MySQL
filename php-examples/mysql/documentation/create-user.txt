This document describes how to create the php user for our database examples.

1. First, go follow the directions in the restore-database.txt file, then continue here.

2. Once you've restored the database, go to the MAMP start page.  You can get at the MAMP start page from the MAMP application window.

*Make sure MAMP is running before you do this.*

3. Go to the phpMyAdmin tab on the start page. Click on the "Databases" tab.  When the new page loads, click on the database named "php-examples".

4. Now that you're looking at the admin page for "php-examples", click on the "Priviledges" tab.  Now click on the "Add user" link near the bottom of the page.

5. Once this menu is loaded, put "php-examples" as the user name.  Then, click the "Host" menu and select "local".  Now type in "php-examples" for the password in both password fields.

6. Finally, make sure that the radio button for 'Grant all privileges on database "php-examples"' is selected under "Database for user".  
Now click on the "Add user" button, and your work is done here.
