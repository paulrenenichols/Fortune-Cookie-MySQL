This document describes how to create the php user for our database examples.

First, go follow the directions in the restore-database.txt file, then continue here.

Once you've restored the database, go to the MAMP start page.  You can get at the MAMP start page from the MAMP application window.  
Make sure MAMP is running before you do this.

Go to the phpMyAdmin tab on the start page. Click on the "Databases" tab.  When the new page loads, click on the database named "php-examples".

Now that you're looking at the admin page for "php-examples", click on the "Priviledges" tab.  Now click on the "Add user" link near the bottom of the page.

Once this menu is loaded, put "php-examples" as the user name.  Then, click the "Host" menu and select "local".  Now type in "php-examples" for the password in both password fields.
Finally, make sure that the radio button for 'Grant all privileges on database "php-examples"' is selected under "Database for user".  
Now click on the "Add user" button, and your work is done here.
